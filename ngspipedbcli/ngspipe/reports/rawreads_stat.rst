summary of reads produced
=========================

The details of the data quality are as follows:

#. Sample name：sample names
#. Raw reads：Count the original sequence data, and count the number of sequencing sequences in each file with four rows in a unit
#. Clean reads：The calculation method is the same as that of Raw reads, except that the statistical files are filtered sequencing data, and the subsequent bioinformatics analysis is based on Clean reads.
#. Clean bases：The number of sequencing sequences is multiplied by the length of the sequencing sequence and converted to G as the unit
#. Error rate：Base sequencing error rate
#. Q20、Q30：Respectively indicate the percentage of bases with Phred values greater than 20 and 30 to the total bases
#. GC content：The total number of bases G and C as a percentage of the total number of bases
