## About Linux
- The complete Linux operating system includes the kernel and outer layer applications. Different Linux distributions use the same kernel and different outer layer applications. 
- Common Linux distributions are [Ubuntu](), [red hat](), [SuSE](), [Gentoo](), [CentOS]() and [Debian](). 
- Shell is the interface between the linux kernel and the user.

## Get Linux

1. Install Ubuntu in a virtual environment.<Font color = red> Not suggested to novices.</Font>
2. Buy a Ubuntu.
3. Apply for an account at the Instituteâ€™s Supercomputer Center. <Font color = red> This is the most common method.</Font>

#### Log into Linux sever from Windows

1. Download a Secure Shell (ssh) terminal.
Common terminal:
    - Xshell: [https://www.xshellcn.com/](https://www.xshellcn.com/)
    - PuTTY: [http://www.putty.org/](http://www.putty.org/)

2. Install the shell terminal.

3. Create a new session.

4. Choose the ssh protocol and enter the host IP, port, user ID and password.

5. Click `connect`.

#### Log into Linux sever from Linux or Mac

Type command in terminal: `ssh [host IP:port]@[user ID]`. Then enter the password.

## Basic knowledge of Linux

1. The absolute path is identified by a forward slash (`/`), and the structure of directory is tree structure.

2. How to use linux command: enter the command at the shell prompt: `$`. Command like: `[Path]/command [-option parameter]  [file|directory]`.
For example: `~/miniconda3/envs/RNA/bin/fastp -i /home/sysbio/SRR8467686.fastq.gz`

3. Enter a single dot (`.`) to indicate the current directory, and enter a double dot (`..`) to indicate the parent directory of the current directory.
For example: `cd ..`

4. Use the man command to view the operation manual of all required commands. Command like: `man [command name]`.
For example: `man cp`

5. Filter: The filter refers to the name of the specified file and is used after many commands. Add a filter after the ls command, then only the information of the file will be displayed.
For example: `ls -l my_file`
This command specifies the relevant information of the output file my_file.
<Font color = red> When writing a filter, you can use a question mark (`?`) to represent a character, an asterisk (`*`) to represent zero or more characters, and use the tab key (`Tab`) to quickly complete the file name or directory first name.</Font>

6. The `which` command is used to find the path of the command. Command like: `which grep`
For example: `which fastp`

## About permission

#### View the file permission

When you use `ls -l` command, the permissions will be marked at the beginning of the file, like: drwxrwxrwx. The first letter represents the type of file: `d` means directory, `-` means file, and `l` means soft link. The remaining nine letters are grouped into three, representing the permissions for the owner, the owner`s` group, and other groups. `r` means read-only. `w` means allowing user to modify the content of the file. `x` means allowing user to execute the file as a program. `-` means having no such permission.

#### Modify permissions: chmod command

<Font color = red>You must have the authority to operate files</Font>
Command like: `chmod (user permissions) (group permissions) (other permissions) file`
Permission is expressed in octal code: r=4, w=2, x=1
For example: `chmod 755 test.txt`
The result is `-rwxr-xr-x test.txt`

## Command about directory

#### Check files which are in the directory list

1. Basic list function: ls command
  Command like: ls various parameters directory name
    - `-F` Distinguish between files and directories
    - `-R` Recursive option to list files in subdirectories contained in the current directory
    - `-l` Produces a long list of output results, including information about each file
    - `-d` Lists only the information of the directory itself, not its contents
    - `-i` The inode number of the file, which is the unique identifier of the file
    - `-a` Display both hidden files and ordinary files
    - `-t` Sort by time modified
    - `-h` Show file size easy to read for human
<Font color = red>The parameters can be combined and written. For example: `ls -ltrh`.</Font>

2. The way to output the tree list: tree tool
   The tool needs to be installed by yourself. Command like: `tree ./`.

#### Create a directory: mkdir command

Command like: `mkdir [directory name]`
To create multiple directories and subdirectories, you can use the `-p` parameter. For example: `mkdir -p New_file/work/file1`.
<Font color = red>The `-p` parameter in the mkdir command can create missing parent directories as needed.</Font>
   
#### Delete directory: rmdir command

Command like: `rmdir [-option parameter] [directory name]`
- `-No` Parameters after rmdir delete empty directories
- `-rf` Delete all contents in the directory
- `-i` Ask a question before deleting

<Font color = red>Because Linux does not have a recycle bin, you must add the -i parameter when deleting to confirm whether the deleted content is correct.</Font>

#### Switch the directory: cd command

Command like: `cd directory`
For example: `cd /usr/bin`

#### View the current absolute path of current directory

Command like: `pwd`
  
## Command about file

#### Create a file: touch command

Command like: `touch [-option parameter] [file name]`
- Create a new file without adding parameters after touch, if the file already exists, change the modification time.
- `-a` Change the access time of an existing file
  
#### Delete files: rm command

Command like: `rm -i [file name]`
<Font color = red>Because Linux does not have a recycle bin, you must add the `-i` parameter to avoid errors when deleting.</Font>
  
#### Copy files: cp command

Command like: `cp [-option parameter] [file name]`
- `-i` Force to ask if you need to overwrite existing files
- `-R` Copy the entire directory recursively
<Font color = red>To avoid errors, it is recommended to add the -i parameter</Font>

## Rename and move files: mv command

1. Rename
  Command like: `mv [original file name] [new file name]`
  
2. Move
  Command like: `mv [file name in the original path] [target new path]`
  
3. Rename and move operations can be performed at the same time
  For example: `mv /home/picture/book /home/file/cook`. Move the `book` file in the `picture` folder to the `file` folder, and rename it to `cook`.
  
## View files

#### View file type: file command

Command like: `file [file name]`
You can check the file type, character encoding method, whether the file can be run, etc.
 
#### View the entire file content

1. `cat` command: display all data in the text file
Command like: `cat [-option parameter] [file name]`
    - No parameters after cat means display content.
    - `-n` Display content after adding line number.
    - `-b` Displays only after adding line numbers to text content.
    - `-T` Does not display tabs, replace tabs with ^T to display.

2. `more` command: display the content of the text file, but it will stop after each page is displayed.

3. `less` command: display the content of text files and support more advanced interaction.

### View a part of file content

1. `head` command: view the beginning of the file
Command like: `head -n file name`
`n` is the number of rows displayed

2. `tail` command: view the end of the file
Command like: `tail -n file name`
`n` is the number of rows displayed

### Upload files, download files

3. The difference between ps and top command
The ps command displays information at a specific time point, and the top command displays real-time information.

## End the process

1. kill command
command like: `kill PID` or `kill -s [process signal]`
